# Simple-Automation-Scripts
A few simple automation scripts, nothing special or fancy, just useful bits of code.

As a heads up, there will be a few scripts in this repository that are a bit outdated and here more for archive purposes.
None the less, they should provide a good starting point for similar projects should anyone be interested in doing so
